# Optimizing Household Electricity through Data Science
 Optimizing Electricity consumption through Machine Learning to save electricity as well as reduce the electricity bill
 
WattTrack(TheCoolKidz) is a simple dashboard developed using Dash and Plotly. It helps the consumer monitor their electricity consumption on a daily basis. WattTrack(TheCoolKidz) also does a forecasting of the electricity, thus helping the consumer an estimation of his/her electricity bill. For future works, we plan to also send early warnings by sending an email containing a report to the user regarding the excessive electricity consumption or when it detects fa faulty device at home.
