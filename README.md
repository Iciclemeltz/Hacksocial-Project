# Optimizing Household Electricity through Data Science
 Optimizing Electricity consumption through Machine Learning to save electricity as well as reduce the electricity bill
 
WattTrack(TheCoolKidz) is a simple dashboard developed using Dash and Plotly. It helps the consumer monitor their electricity consumption on a daily basis. WattTrack(TheCoolKidz) also does a forecasting of the electricity, thus helping the consumer an estimation of his/her electricity bill.

## Installation and running the program
1. Firstly download this folder to your computer or desktop
2. Open up Visual Studio Code or any program that can run python code.
3. install the requirements by doing pip3 install -r requirements.txt to install the neccessary packages.
4. Open the app.py and run by: python app.py.
5. a local development server will be created and the dashboard will be shown with 4 features to be selected from the dropdown box.

## Future Works:
We plan to improve it by sending early warnings using an email containing a report to the user regarding the excessive electricity consumption or when it detects a faulty device at home. 
In addition, converting this to an mobile application will also be ideal as users can track on their mobile devices instead of going to a website. The mobile app can also send alerts to user once it reaches certain threshold like excessive electricity consumption of a faulty device.
Lastly, currently the data is being read from csv files. For future plans, the approach would be for users to upload their electricity bills data and the application will be able to process it and display to the users for visualisation.
